# 1.5.1 -- 2023-07-21

Feedback from publishing my dissertation:

- [class] Fix footnotes appearing outside of type area
- [example] Work on apppendix format
- [example] Fix running head of bibliography only appearing on even pages (solution is to add the bibliography to toc with class option "toc=bib," and not to call "heading=bibintoc" in \printbibliography)

- Worked on title page (now has english title as required by faculty 7)
- class now has a `smallfont` option for more space (12 pt in A4/manuscript)
- class now has a `oneside` option for onesided print of the manuscript
